The last year and a half I have been diving into game hacking. At my university I could choose to do a passion project as a course as long as I could get atleast one professor to be on board. The game hacking topic takes a lot of research and is very hard however so does university. Why not then just hack videogames on university time? So I did. I asked one of our infosec professors if I could do game hacking. I got the fealing that he didn't really understand what I was doing, but he was on board. At the end of the semester and I showed off my pdf, code and presentaiton I got the impression that they were impressed and passed the class.

I decided that after having this course graded I would publish all the source code and texts related to this project and I hope you the end user will enjoy this project as much as I did making it.
